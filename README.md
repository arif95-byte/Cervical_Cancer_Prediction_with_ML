# Cervical_Cancer_Prediction_with_ML


In this project, I developed and trained an XGBoost classifier to predict an individual's risk of cervical cancer. The dataset, collected from 858 patients at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela, included features like the number of pregnancies, smoking habits, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), demographics, and medical history. I conducted exploratory data analysis and visualization on the training set, prepared the data, and split it into training and test datasets before model training. The XGBoost algorithm was trained and evaluated for this task using the scikit-learn library in Python. The model achieved an accuracy of 99.56% on the training set and 95.35% on the test set.
